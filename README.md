# Login & Sign Up Form

This project is a React-based authentication form component that toggles between login and signup modes. The component features a simple interface with buttons to switch between forms, inputs for user credentials (email and password), and a "Forgot Password" link. The form conditionally renders either the login or signup fields based on the current state.
